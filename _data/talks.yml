  title: "Inside Hotel California: how the Internet giants dominate through culture and technology"
  keynote: true
  extract: >
    If you want to know what really drives the world, just follow
    the money.  This talk will offer a different view on common cultural
    mantras and technical trends of the Internet, such as "the Internet
    should not be regulated", "there should not be national borders online",
    "let's encrypt everything" and "the Web is the Internet", showing how in 
    today's economy they suit the business and political interests of the
    big Internet giants and of surveillance capitalism in general. It will
    start by looking at where the revenues of these companies actually come 
    from, and show how regulation and personal/national points of network
    control, like ad blockers and content filters, represent a big strategic
    risk for these companies, explaining their efforts to make those
    practices culturally unpopular.  As a case study, the new DNS-over-HTTPS
    protocol will be examined in technical and policy terms, showing how,
    while providing better privacy and security in some use cases, it also
    addresses that strategic risk for those companies. To end on a positive
    note, regulatory efforts for a European political response will be
    summarized, and the open, cooperative, interoperable model based on free
    software and open standards will be presented as the possible way
    forward for the European Internet community.

  title: "It takes two to DevOps"
  extract: >
    In common parlance (and marketing/recruitment speak) DevOps
    has transformed into a noun but that's misleading as you cannot be "a 
    DevOps".  Some say it's an adjective and a ‘DevOps person’ is someone
    who cares about and supports the DevOps principles while others suggest
    it's an adverb, so we can use it to describe how we do things rather
    than to describe ourselves.  Either way DevOps itself was never meant to
    be the goal but rather a mean to an end and we will argue the its key
    goal is to ensure that software runs well in Production, especially in
    the context of regular changes (deployments). If you lead a team and
    want to understand why and how to make your software systems work
    better, then this talk is for you.
